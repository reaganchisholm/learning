## Misc Thoughts
- Editor had a super quick setup, was running in no time, surprised me.
- Going through the official docs

## Overview
- Four main concepts: Trees, Scenes, Nodes, Signals

### Scenes
- These can be as small as you want, kind of like components
- You can nest scenes within other scenes

### Nodes
- Smallest building block, scenes are made up of nodes
- Godot provides a base of useful node types, like 2D, 3D and user interface.

### Signals
- You can send out events from nodes via signals. It's Godots version of the observer pattern. Just like an event and event listener in JS world

## Sizing
- Really helpful video about sizing that demonstrates the different sizes [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad-3dn2qUUs)
- With smaller sprites its better to communicate a smaller amount of details well then try and include a bunch of different things, the details will become super busy
- When learning, stick to small to medium size sprites (16-62) with less details
